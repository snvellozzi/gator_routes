# Gator Routes

Problem:
We are trying to find a solution for unreliable public transportation. We aim to do this by showing the shortest amount of time (in minutes) that it takes to travel from one    location to another via bus routes.

Motivation:
One of the most common issues with bus transportation is the lack of accuracy in the departure and arrival time of the bus for users. Therefore, we propose a solution that will help users better under which bus route to take to arrive at their location in the shortest time span. Also, through our solution, we hope that people will be drawn to use bus transportation which could reduce the amount of gas emission that gets released into the environment.

Features implemented:
We know we have solved the problem when we are able to accurately generate the path of the shortest amount of time from one destination to another via bus routes. The most important feature is the weights on the edges that represent the time it takes to travel from one location to another via bus.
